# [digitalocean-k8s-challenge](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/pages/kubernetes-challenge#anchor--challenges)

## challenge
The main challenge I chose was to deploy a gitops CI/CD implementation with tekton and argocd. Because this is a great learning opportunity, I decided to pile on fluxcd for bootstrapping the cluster, deploying ambassador instead of a 'classic' ingress controller and configuring certmanager to manage a wildcard certificate.
In the next sections I'll list up the technologies I've used along the way, what I've learned, what went well and what didn't.

## terraform
I was already familiar with terraform, so setting up a k8s cluster on digital ocean was fairly straightforward. Especially when following the [starter kit](https://github.com/digitalocean/Kubernetes-Starter-Kit-Developers/).
Caveat: don't check in secrets! I did at some point, but github was so kind to warn me about it, so I removed them from the repo and rotated the affected secrets.

## fluxcd
This technology was pretty new to me, so I was pretty curious. Again a lot of help from the [starter kit](https://github.com/digitalocean/Kubernetes-Starter-Kit-Developers/)!
Once set up, it's very easy to deploy helm charts and kustomized manifests. I tried it out with prometheus, grafana and loki.
Caveat: There was an issue with the known hosts config from github. [This issue](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/discussions/2097) explains it best and also offers a solution.
TLDR:
```
kubectl patch secret -n flux-system flux-system -p '{"data":{"known_hosts":"Z2l0aHViLmNvbSBlY2RzYS1zaGEyLW5pc3RwMjU2IEFBQUFFMlZqWkhOaExYTm9ZVEl0Ym1semRIQXlOVFlBQUFBSWJtbHpkSEF5TlRZQUFBQkJCRW1LU0VOalFFZXpPbXhrWk15N29wS2d3RkI5bmt0NVlScllNak51RzVOODd1UmdnNkNMcmJvNXdBZFQveTZ2MG1LVjBVMncwV1oyWUIvKytUcG9ja2c9"}}'
kubectl -n flux-system rollout restart deployment/source-controller
```

## certmanager+ambassador
Setup was easy, configuring a cluster-wide wildcard certificate took more of an effort. First you need a domain name and point it to digital ocean's name servers. Next [this guide](https://github.com/digitalocean/Kubernetes-Starter-Kit-Developers/blob/main/03-setup-ingress-controller/guides/wildcard_certificates.md) explains the rest of the process step for step, except for 1 thing: you need to point your domain name to the k8s load balancer.

## argocd
Deploying argocd is again pretty straight forward when you follow their getting started guide. Exposing the UI with an ambassador mapping took me some time because I had to figure out I had to disable TLS on argocd to prevent an endless redirect loop (ambassador -> argocd -> ambassador -> argocd -> ...). To train my new fluxcd skills, I backported the installation of argocd, the mapping and disabling TLS to fluxcd using a kustomization.

## tekton
This last step was by far the most complex to understand and implement. [This blog post](https://medium.com/dzerolabs/installing-ambassador-argocd-and-tekton-on-kubernetes-540aacc983b9) helped a lot! In short I deployed 2 pipelines: 1 that gets triggered by a github webhook from [this repo](https://github.com/fransguelinckx/tekton-pipeline-example-app) and 1 that gets triggered by the first one to deploy the app (2048 game) that was built, using argocd. After some trial and error I got it working, yay!
In retrospect I like the cloud-nativeness of tekton and it certainly triggered my interest. Although it will still take some time to get used to the concepts and terminology of it.

## digital ocean
A big thank you to the people of digital ocean for organizing and facilitating this k8s challenge üëèüèª! Had a lot of fun experimenting with their platform and tinkering with new technologies.
